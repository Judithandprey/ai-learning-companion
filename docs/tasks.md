# Task board

P0 authorized by the user on 2026-09-28 UTC. Product requirements remain intact.
Setup is verified; application capability gates are not yet passed. Lead integrates
all deliveries into main and verifies the resulting commit before reporting success.

GitHub sync is awaiting a visibility decision: live reads returned public although
the recorded upload authorization is private-only. No new push was made during
that check; see `verification/lead/github-visibility-mismatch.md`.

| ID | Owner | State | Deliverable / prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SETUP-01 | Lead | Verified | Six role chats/worktrees; see verification/setup.md. |
| SETUP-02 | Lead + web | Verified | Actual legacy and async message replies; no application claims. |
| P0-01 | Lead | Foundation committed/tested | Baseline 91019c3, contract v0.1.0, locked toolchains, traceability; 42 tests and TypeScript check passed; module/provider integration pending. |
| P0-02 | Web | Dispatched; delivery accepted | Explicit selection/quiet card probe; fixed source anchors; desktop evidence separate from G1 device checks. |
| P0-03 | iOS | Dispatched; delivery accepted | G1/G2/G3/G5 capability matrix, exact environment and device steps; bounded source only if verifiable. |
| P0-04 | Backend | Blocked by worker setup-only instruction | Worker has not attempted merge or implementation; direct user authorization requested. No approval rejection occurred for this task. Toolchain baseline c58c21e is ready. |
| P0-05 | Learning | Blocked by worker authorization review | Assignment accepted, but worker reports baseline Git merge denied under its prior setup-only authorization. No implementation started; direct user authorization requested. |
| P0-06 | QA | Waiting for integrated candidate | Independently reproduce consequential changes on a fixed commit. |
| P0-07 | Lead + owners | Waiting for modules/device path | Early select → silent card → save → reopen → recover source probe; distinguish fixtures from actual-course P1. |

## Shared dispatch baseline and boundaries

Repository base: `4684b79ed979ad5162e1c86635a245d68601da84`. The dispatch message
supplies the exact new P0-01 contract commit; workers fast-forward their clean
assigned branch to that commit before editing. Contract version: `0.1.0`.
Actual baseline: `91019c3fd548e47aca632136012bb961c4af07cb`. The three accepted
mailbox receipts are recorded in `verification/lead/p0-first-dispatch.json`.
Receipt acceptance is not a claim that worker execution or verification completed.
Confirm branch, unrelated changes, baseline and owned paths first. Do not reset or
switch other worktrees. If a shared change is required, send lead a concrete request.
No paid product APIs, account registration, publication, purchase or unrelated
messages are authorized by these task cards. Official documentation research and
reversible local implementation/tests are authorized.

Return a committed delivery with commands/results, evidence, limitations, and
unverified conditions. Use the actual mailbox reply route and `--reply-to` original
assignment ID. Do not acknowledge receipt unless it resolves a concrete blocker.

## P0-02 / web

- Goal: R01/R03/R06–10/R46, G1, A01–03/A26 supporting probe, not full acceptance.
- Write: `apps/safari-extension/**`, `docs/verification/web/**`; module config/tests
  are allowed. Dependency manifests/locks, shared contracts, root config stay lead-owned.
- Implement explicit NAV/ASK/WRITE behavior and an English-first silent card probe
  in an owned test page. No selection in NAV/WRITE and no ordinary finger interception.
  Use `packages/contracts` types; immutable source/version anchors and honest
  `dom_snapshot` versus actual screenshot capability. Return prior mode on done/cancel.
- Fixture card only for a known fixture; arbitrary text must show provider unavailable,
  not a fabricated explanation. Use safe text rendering and no page credentials.
- Acceptance: compile TS; deterministic mode/anchor tests; run available browser
  checks on owned fixture, enumerate iframe/fullscreen/captions/cross-origin limits.
  Retain all actual failures. Do not log into a real course or distribute an extension.
  iPad/Pencil support remains untested until a real device path exists.

## P0-03 / ios

- Goal: R01/R03/R07–10/R29/R35–36/R46–48; G1/G2/G3/G5;
  A02–03/A12/A14–16/A26–28 supporting capability evidence.
- Write: `apps/ios/**`, `docs/verification/platform/**`.
- Inspect installed skills/playbooks and local public environment indicators for a
  real Mac/Xcode/remote build route, without searching credentials or private authority.
  Research current primary platform documentation. Record doc claims separately from
  executed tests: Safari/native messaging, Pencil/finger input, cross-App overlays,
  screen/audio capture, explicit stop versus background lifecycle, share/import.
- Acceptance: capability matrix with version/source/date, preferred/fallback paths,
  minimal build/sign/install steps, device test checklist and exact user inputs needed.
  No global overlay promise, paid cloud provisioning or extensive uncompiled Swift.
  Test tiny platform-independent probes only if useful; report compilation honestly.

## P0-05 / learning

- Goal: R04/R17/R27–32/R43–44/R50; G6; A04/A09–12/A19/A23 supporting evaluations.
- Write: `services/learning/**`, `services/worker/learning/**`,
  `tests/fixtures/memory/**`, `tests/evals/**`, `docs/verification/learning/**`.
- Approved fixture scope: project-authored synthetic content only, test-only consent,
  English teaching text with short Chinese recall clues where useful. Use v0.1.0
  source/frame/observation provenance; original UTF-8/artifact hashes and stable IDs.
- At least 30 fuzzy/history-correction queries plus 50 exact-history queries, distinct
  labels and plausible distractors. Include actor separation, same concept across
  courses, rare early detail, corrections, missing media and changed source versions.
- Implement a deterministic reproducible lexical + metadata baseline and an evaluation
  command reporting top-5 correct-source recall, latency/sample count, failures and
  zero paid calls. Demonstrate original records unchanged after index rebuild/restart.
  Do not tune on all evaluation answers or hide failures. No second identity/archive.
- Graphiti is a candidate, not a selected production dependency. Research a bounded
  same-input comparison and request exact dependencies/budget controls if required.
  Without an executed real candidate comparison, G6 stays incomplete.

## P0-04 / backend

- Goal: R02/R04/R27–33/R38–41/R43–44/R46–47; A10–12/A17–18/A21/A23/A27
  supporting skeleton; G4 real account connectivity remains a separate gate.
- Write: `services/api/**`, `services/worker/core/**`,
  `services/worker/connectors/**`, `docs/verification/backend/**`. Backend owns
  migrations under its module. Lead owns shared HTTP/wire schemas and dependencies.
- Baseline: dispatch supplies exact commit containing the backend optional lock.
  Install with `uv sync --frozen --extra backend --group backend-test`.
  FastAPI 0.141.1, Uvicorn 0.54.0, Psycopg 3.3.6, HTTPX 0.28.1 are pinned.
- Implement an executable API and PostgreSQL repository/migrations for immutable
  source snapshots, exact event batch ACKs and revisioned notes. Keep URL registration
  distinct from fetched/parsed content. All references enforce authenticated ownership.
  Same event ID/content is a duplicate; changed payload or reused device sequence is
  409. Mixed invalid batches roll back entirely. Server `received_at` must not break
  replay fingerprints. Note CAS preserves history, original ink and separate AI layers.
- Auth: explicit local test authenticator only; reject access without configured
  authentication. Anonymous/expired/insufficient scope and body identity spoofing
  fail closed. Do not call a test token login real OAuth.
- Budget: 100,000 CNY fen/month in America/Los_Angeles, trusted server month,
  known versioned price/FX, atomic reservations, idempotent settle/release, retry
  exposure included. Unknown execution outcome retains reservation pending
  reconciliation. No paid executor is enabled by this task.
- Worker begin/commit checks include authorization, source version, tombstone and
  cancellation. Final check/derived write must be transactionally protected;
  historical offline upload never reactivates live capture. Tests cover deterministic
  stale-job sequences plus real DB transaction races when a test instance exists.
- Scope HTTP to source registration/read, event batch, note CAS/read, usage and job
  cancellation. Fixed fixture snapshot/frame import may be a controlled local entry
  point. No full OAuth, scraping, media transport or production queue in this slice.
  Propose exact HTTP request/response schemas to lead before diverging from contracts.
- Acceptance: pure domain and in-process ASGI checks; real PostgreSQL migration,
  restart/readback, two-connection CAS/idempotency, concurrent budget and delete/job
  race suite. A missing dedicated DSN must explicitly block DB acceptance, not produce
  a green skip. SQLite/in-memory tests cannot prove PostgreSQL correctness.
- Environment: no docker/podman/psql/postgres/initdb currently found. Prepare SQL
  and a clearly gated integration command; do not provision cloud/accounts or silently
  change the chosen DB. Prefer HTTPX AsyncClient+ASGITransport for current local
  framework checks; the initial synchronous TestClient probe did not complete.
- Deliver commit, module test commands/results, no-secret env example, startup and
  migration/rollback instructions, real/untested separation and required DB conditions.
  Do not bypass any worktree approval denial; return its precise reason.
